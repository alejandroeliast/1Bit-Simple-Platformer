# 1Bit Simple Platformer
 
### Description
1 Bit Jumper is a 2D Platformer game inspired by games like Celeste and the Mario games. The player is able to jump, wall jump, climb and dash to avoid obstacles and read the goal of the level. Over the course of a week, I worked on the design and programming of the game, making use of the tilemap capabilities of Unity and finding new ways to improve the character controller. The goal of this project was to make a playable game in a week that could be expanded upon.

The art was a free tile set done by Kenney.
